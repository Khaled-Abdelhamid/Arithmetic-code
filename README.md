# Arithmatic-code
this is a full impolementation of finite precision Arthimatic encoder / decoder done by integer operations

the algorithm is based upon stanford  paper [Arethmetic coding for data compression](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee398a/handouts/papers/WittenACM87ArithmCoding.pdf) by IAN H. WIllEN, RADFORD M. NEAL, and JOHN G. CLEARY
A very helpful tutorial I found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouYV3rBtrTI&list=PLAYOgbPjyv4QX4aK95PfNYta7H_pjI_Fl)
